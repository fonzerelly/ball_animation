Bouncing Balls
=========

This is a tiny Example application, which animates balls bouncing inside a container.
I tried to get to know Angular2 with it and wanted to see the major performance improvemnt,
that Angular2 promises due to virtualDOM-Rendering. Unfortunatelly I can't really see
a big difference. Maybe my implementation is not using the virtualDOM-Rendering properly.
In that case I am looking forward to your feedback.
